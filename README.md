# Easy Peasy, Lemon Squeezy!

Bootcamp buddies would like to present Squeezy, a website where you can order your citrus to stave of scurvy. Built and designed to be a submission for our Michigan State University Bootcamp's Final Project. We have built a working webstore, for a fictional company - Squeezy. Based on a full stack MERN collaboration to showcase the class knowledge we have gained.
